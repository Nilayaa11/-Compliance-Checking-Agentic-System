Netflix Terms of Use
Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content (“Netflix content”) over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("Netflix ready devices").
These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and accessing Netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Use indicate the member who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged.
Membership
1.1. Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).
1.2. We may offer a number of subscription plans, including subscriptions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Netflix subscription by visiting the netflix.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.
Promotional Offers.
We may from time to time offer special promotional offers
(such as sweepstakes, discounts and other incentives)
, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or your contact information to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to you.
Billing and Cancellation
3.1.
Billing Cycle
. The subscription fee for the Netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription plan that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
3.2.
Payment Methods
. To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
3.3.
Updating your Payment Methods
. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. On the "Account" page you can see when your account will close. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party.

4.8. Netflix software is developed by, or for, Netflix and may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access Netflix content through Netflix ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices.

You agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the Netflix software and related third-party software.

You waive all special, indirect and consequential damages against us. These terms will not limit any non-waivable warranties or mandatory consumer protection rights that apply to you.
Class Action Waiver.
WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Communication and Marketing Preferences
Email and Text Messages.
If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, please access the “Notification settings” option for the relevant profile within the “Account” section of our website. Alternatively, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message (note: you may receive a confirmation text message in this case). Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from transactional messages from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
Push Notifications.
You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. Netflix will send you push notifications from time to time in accordance with any notification preferences you have set on your mobile device. If you later decide you no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device’s settings to turn them off (or via the “Notification settings” described in the preceding section). Please note that individual Netflix games may have their own push notifications (you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off). We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and later decide you no longer want to receive them, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off.
Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix.
Some third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing about Netflix content or the Netflix service by sending privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use pseudonymization technologies (such as hashing) to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with both Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices regarding the Matched Identifier Communications in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website.
Marketing of the Netflix service using cookies and similar technologies.
To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs collected for marketing of the Netflix service or Netflix content on third party service, please use the tools described in the “
Cookies and other Technologies
” section below.
Advertising Choices
Behavioral Advertising Choices
We respect your behavioral advertising preferences, and you can turn off behavioral advertisements at any time by changing the “Behavioral Advertising” setting located in the “Privacy and data settings” menu (for the relevant profile) of the “Account” section of our website.
If your behavioral advertisements setting is off, you will still see Advertisements, but they will be non-behavioral advertisements.
An option to opt out is not provided in a Kids profile because we do not engage in behavioral advertising on Kids profiles.
Digital Advertising Alliance Opt Out Control
Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for behavioral advertising:

Section C: Access to Account and Profiles
Sharing your account with others:
As a Netflix member, if you share your account with others in your household, please ensure that they are aware of and have read this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to their use of Netflix (except sections that only apply to the member, such as those related to payments). Please note that the member controls the Netflix account and all profiles, the information in the account and all profiles, and whether to share (or stop sharing) the account with individuals in their household.
If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they may be able to see viewing information, account information in the “Account” section of the service, and game related information such as chat contents and saved game information. This remains true even when you use the profiles feature, although you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile (see
help.netflix.com/node/114277
). Please note that viewing history, recommendations, “continue watching” and similar information may be made available through various features and user experiences, such as Partner interfaces that are integrated with the Netflix service.
Profiles:
Profiles allow users on a Netflix account to have a personalized Netflix experience, built around the Netflix content of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles, and information within or associated with the profile (although, as noted above, you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile). You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not want them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number, or other information to the profile and will be provided with a notice at the time such information is provided (the “Profile Privacy Notice” applies – see
help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy
). We also have various parental controls available and you can learn more here:
help.netflix.com/node/264
.
Profile Transfers:
The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information such as viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the “Account” section of our website. You can learn more here:
help.netflix.com/node/122698
.
Account Login Features:
You may have the option to use certain account login features, such as email-based or text message-based login, or easier login to the Netflix app on certain devices. Please note that any device that is logged into your account will remain logged in unless you log out of those devices (following the instructions in the section below).
Removing device access to your Netflix account:
To remove access to your Netflix account from devices that are logged into the account, visit the “Account” section of our website, locate the “Sign out of all devices” option, and follow the instructions to sign out of your devices. Users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each session. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, be sure to first log out. If you or other users on the account do not maintain the security of your email address, password, and signed-in devices, or fail to log out a device you sell or return, then others may be able to access your Netflix account, including your personal information.
Section D: Cookies and other Technologies
We, our Service Providers, Netflix Marketing Providers, and Advertising Companies use cookies, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags), hashed identifiers, and resettable device identifiers for various reasons. This section explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below “
How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?
”
Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, Hashed Identifiers, and Resettable Device Identifiers
Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.
We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.
We may also create, use, and disclose hashed identifiers. As described above, hashing is a process of converting the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information.
If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
Why Does Netflix Use These Technologies?
We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to support Advertisements; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce the Netflix Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.
We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our service. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.
Netflix uses hashed identifiers and resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, to support Advertisements (including delivering Advertisements to you), and for analytics and optimization purposes.

. We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track" signals.
To exercise choice regarding hashed identifiers for Netflix Marketing
To exercise choice regarding Netflix’s use of hashed identifiers for Netflix marketing communications on third party services, please configure the appropriate setting under Matched Identifier Communications in the "Privacy and data settings" (for the relevant profile) within the "Account" section of our website.
To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers
To exercise choice regarding Netflix’s use of resettable device identifiers (for marketing the Netflix service or Netflix content, or as used to support Advertisements), please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device settings). If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix and Advertisements on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier. Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device.
To exercise choice regarding other similar technologies
In addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.
In addition to these choices, if you want to exercise your choices for behavioral advertising on Netflix, please see “Advertising Choices” above.
Section E: Other Important Privacy Disclosures
Sharing Functionality in our Service
You can use sharing functionality available in our service to disclose your personal information in the following ways:
certain portions of our service may give you options to share information by email, text message, and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and apps on your device; and
social plugins and similar technologies that allow you to share information.
Social plugins and social applications are operated by third-party social networks, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some Netflix game features may require use of a third party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.
Security
We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical, and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.
Retention of Personal Information
We may retain personal information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes, and as otherwise necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
Specifically, we retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide our service; to administer and operate our business; to research, analyze, and improve our services; to send marketing and informational messages; to support Advertisements; for safety, security, and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce the Netflix Terms of Use. Our retention of personal information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, whether you are a current Netflix member), the nature of the personal information, our legal obligations, and the need to defend or resolve current or anticipated legal claims.
We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For information about retention of personal information, please see:
help.netflix.com/node/126558

In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service. These third parties have their own privacy policies.
For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes, gaming systems, and other internet-connected devices. These platforms have separate privacy statements, notices, and terms of use, which we recommend you review.
We may provide support for the Netflix service (such as an online support forum for Netflix customer support, or a particular Netflix game). Information that you post or make available on such sites and forums are publicly available (unless otherwise noted on the site or forum).

We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory, or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) as required by law.
